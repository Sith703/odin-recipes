    <h2>A Central Vietnamese Favourite</h2>
    
        <p>It's got that irresistible crispy, yet delicate, golden brown crust. And the inside of the bánh xèo is filled with delicious flavors: pork and shrimp, and sprinklings of mung bean, onions and bean sprouts.</p>
        <p>This crowd pleaser is a hot-off-the-pan, hands-on food meant to be wrapped in veggies and dipped in a flavorful sauce. Vietnamese bánh xèo, often called Vietnamese pancakes, or Vietnamese crêpes, are great for family style dinners and you can prep the batter a night ahead of time. Lets get to sizzling!</p>
    
    <h3>What Does Banh xèo Mean?</h3>
        <p>I always found the name of bánh xèo interesting because the “xèo” refers to the sizzling sound it makes when you cook the batter. Its name loosely means “sizzling cake.” </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Prepare Batter</h4>
        <p>Combine all batter ingredients except scallions in a large bowl for at least 3 hours, or overnight. Add scallions only right before making the crêpes.</p>
        <h4>Prepare Fillings</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Steam or soak mung beans in water until soft.</li>
            <li>Boil pork until cooked through and soft, then slice thinly</li>
            <li>Remove shrimp heads and devein shrimp if desired.</li>
            <li>Wash bean sprouts and veggies.</li>

        </ol>
        
        <h4>Making Banh Xeo</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>On medium-high heat add 1-2 teaspoons of oil and some onions</li>
            <li>Immediately add a few pieces of pork and shrimp. Sauté, lightly mixing until very lightly browned and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Pour in some batter and quickly tilt & rotate the pan so the batter is evenly spread. Add more batter if it wasn't enough to cover the pan. There should only be a thin layer of batter that almost flakes off at the pan edges where it's thinner. If your batter doesn't do that and is too thick, add a few tbsp water to the batter and mix to thin it out.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat to medium. Add some mung beans, bean sprouts, and cover with a lid for about 3 minutes, or until bean sprouts are slightly cooked. The batter should also be slightly cooked and transparent around the edges. This step cooks the top side of the ingredients and batter while it steams since we won't be flipping the crepe</li>
            <li>Remove the lid, lower heat to medium-low and wait for the crêpe to become crisp. This takes about 5-7 minutes. This step lets the ingredients fully cook through, including the batter. It also lets steam escape so the batter can crisp up. Brush on a little oil around the edges if you're not seeing or hearing enough batter to pan contact. Fold in half, transfer to a plate and serve immediately. For batter troubleshooting please see the troubleshooting section in the post above.</li>
